# Research Gaps and Future Work

## Current State of Pedestrian Modeling in AV Safety Testing

### 1. Identified Research Gaps

#### 1.1 Behavioral Modeling Limitations

**Gap 1: Deterministic Assumption Bias**
- **Current State**: Most existing pedestrian models assume rational, predictable behavior patterns, creating a significant "reality gap" between simulation and real-world performance
- **Impact**: AVs trained on deterministic models fail catastrophically when encountering human errors
- **Evidence**: Recent studies show only 6% of AV accidents involve pedestrian collisions compared to 42% for conventional vehicles, suggesting AVs are tested against unrealistic pedestrian behaviors

**Gap 2: Cultural Behavioral Variations**
- **Current State**: Pedestrian models largely ignore regional and cultural differences in crossing behaviors
- **Research Need**: Cross-cultural comparative studies show 5-35% variation in jaywalking rates across cultures
- **Missing Elements**:
  - Authority respect variations
  - Risk tolerance cultural patterns
  - Social conformity influences
  - Urban design interaction patterns

**Gap 3: Error Taxonomy Incompleteness**
- **Current State**: Limited classification of pedestrian error types in simulation
- **Missing Error Categories**:
  - Cognitive load effects (multitasking, stress)
  - Age-related perception changes
  - Substance influence modeling
  - Panic response behaviors
  - Group dynamics errors

#### 1.2 Technical Implementation Gaps

**Gap 4: Simulation Fidelity Limitations**
- **Current Challenge**: Existing simulators like CARLA lack environmental dynamics complexity for predicting and controlling realistic pedestrian behavior
- **Specific Deficiencies**:
  - Limited weather interaction modeling
  - Insufficient lighting condition effects
  - Poor audio distraction simulation
  - Inadequate multi-agent social dynamics

**Gap 5: Real-Time Performance Constraints**
- **Issue**: Current pedestrian error models are computationally expensive
- **Requirements**: Real-time AV testing needs <10ms response times
- **Challenge**: Balancing behavioral complexity with computational efficiency

#### 1.3 Validation and Evaluation Gaps

**Gap 6: Metrics Inadequacy**
- **Current Limitation**: Most studies focus on collision avoidance only
- **Missing Metrics**:
  - Passenger comfort degradation quantification
  - Long-term psychological impact of repeated emergency braking
  - Energy efficiency impact of defensive driving
  - Infrastructure wear effects

**Gap 7: Real-World Dataset Scarcity**
- **Data Limitations**:
  - Insufficient pedestrian behavior datasets
  - Limited error behavior documentation
  - Sparse cross-cultural behavioral data
  - Inadequate edge-case scenario documentation

### 2. Technical Challenges and Limitations

#### 2.1 Current Framework Limitations

**Simulation Scope Constraints**:
- Limited to urban intersection scenarios
- Weather conditions simplified
- Night/visibility modeling basic
- Emergency vehicle interactions not modeled


#### 2.2 Research Methodology Challenges

**Data Collection Difficulties**:
- Ethical constraints on error behavior observation
- Cultural sensitivity in cross-regional studies
- Privacy concerns in video-based behavior analysis
- Liability issues in controlled error induction studies

**Validation Complexity**:
- Difficulty isolating specific error module contributions
- Challenge in establishing ground truth for error behaviors
- Limited access to real AV performance data for comparison
- Regulatory restrictions on public road error testing
